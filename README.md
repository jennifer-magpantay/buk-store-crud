# BUK SHOP - CRUD
## Interactive Web Application II | CCT College Dublin 3rd Year

As part of Interactive Web Development II module of the IT degree, students were required to keep working and to improve the first project - an online store. 
As the first requeriments, the application should allow the user to control the stock of products of the application. But for this version, other requirements were asked.

Minimum requirements:
- Create a CRUD application, to create, to read, to update and to delete products;
- Use Postman for the HTPPS requests;
- Manage the data through MongoDB.

Achievements:
- Connection with MongoDB and routes for HTTPS requests added;
- GET, POST and DELETE requests working fine;
- PUT requests working just through Postman.
